They enable efficient synthesis of biomedical research, assist in predicting drug activity, and provide foundational knowledge to patients through online consultations. Additionally, LLMs reduce administrative burdens by automating documentation tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care. However, challenges such as model interpretability, data privacy, and the need for evidence-based validation remain significant.",
